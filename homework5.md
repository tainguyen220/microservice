Adrian Response Paper
<br>
	After attending the presentation Adrian give, I notice that during the presentation on Filbo, Adrian mention that Public API is a very important piece of puzzle in the programs, and I happen to be very interested in Web API.  I find it interesting that the Filbo service have 4 different host in their infrastructure. Public Web API, Internal Web API, Backoffice Web API, and Functions App. I thought that this is very smart because Filbo service as a program must be very large. Often when I write web API for my classes project, I always put all the API into one class page and I thought that was organized but after hearing Adrian talk about how different API should be separated so the program is more organized, I think that is very smart. It would help pinpoint the problem if they were to run into any.

	I can also see that there are two database Repository and a logs Storage. I do not often think about Logs Storage at all when I code a project until I started my Capstone. The Filbo service infrastructure help me understand more on why we need to capture logs since there is so much going on and when a program is running, if we can capture the action each time a program is being used by the user, we could use that statistic to improve certain area of the programs or fix a problem by knowing who causes it or where it was cause.
