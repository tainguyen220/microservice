Microservices Information

With Microservices, individual application features can be built and deploy quickly and allow organization to prevent 
application that cause bottleneck. To adopt microservices (MSA), organization must be able to invest in people, process,
and platform. Micro if often refer to as “small” but not necessarily in microservice. Microservice is an independently 
deployable component. The term does not indicate the size of the delivery value of the component.
