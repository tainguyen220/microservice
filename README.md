# microservice

With Microservices, individual application features can be built and deploy quickly and allow organization to prevent 
application that causes bottleneck. To adopt microservices (MSA), organization must be able to invest in people, process,
and platform. Micro if often refer to as “small” but not necessarily in microservice. Microservice is an independently 
deployable component. The term does not indicate the size of the delivery value of the component. 

Through this reading, I learn a lot more microservice. A good example is the summary that I wrote above. I am starting to think that Microservice does not only focus on only one problem, but they focus on all the problem
revolving around a feature.

Another couples of interesting facts that I read from this article is Microservices owns it data and have private API. Since it is turning problem
around quickly it is independent deployable. Beside Microservices, there's also Miniservice. Miniservice however share it data and publish it API so it is more open. 

Between these two, Miniservice improve Agility but Microservice probably is 
better since it enables continuous delivery. A good example is a project managment
manager will decide which feature to release first on an application. After that
first release, other features could come along to improve the application. There 
could be a strategy where an application will release each feature slowly to keep the audience’s attention on the product. 

I think that microservice is good but it might not be the best option for everyone. There's a benefit but however are problems as well with fast development and deployment. If a feature is quickly being developed and deploy, there is going to be feature that are not stable and bug. This could be a problem because certain application depends heavily on one feature. If many features are being release continously, then there could also be a list of problems coming back for the developer to fix.
